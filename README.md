Diffusion trajectory of atypical morphological development in autism spectrum disorder 
Background 		
	Brain development from childhood through adolescence is crucial for understanding autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet how functional networks regulate developmental changes in brain morphology during this critical period with ASD remains unclear. Here, we analyzed brain morphology and functional connectivity (FC) in 301 participants with ASD and 375 typically developing controls (TDCs) aged 8-18 years from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Employing a sliding window approach, we segmented participants into age-stratified groups and quantified distribution deviations (DEV) in gray matter volume (GMV) between ASD and TDCs using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and expected value analysis. Network diffusion modeling (NDM) was then employed to predict progressive developmental alterations in brain morphology based on early atypical neurodevelopment, and to assess how intrinsic functional networks constrain these changes. we observed a developmental shift in GMV divergence associated with ASD: during early adolescence manifested a positive GMV deviation relative to TDCs, which transitioned to negative during late adolescence. These DEV were primarily localized in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), cingulate gyrus (CG), insula, and superior parietal lobule (SPL). Furthermore, NDM demonstrated cross-stage predictability of atypical neurodevelopment, with DEV values of atypical brain regions at preceding age stages significantly predicting subsequent ones, which was constrained by functional network architecture. These findings highlight a dynamic developmental shift from gray matter overgrowth to delayed maturation during adolescence in ASD and revealing the role of intrinsic functional networks in constraining atypical anatomical development.
